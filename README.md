# Elm+Elixir+OAuth Starter

Elm and Elixir have quickly become two of my favorite progamming languages, and together they've
made building new projects both at home and at work a lot of fun. There are good resources out
there on how to put those projects together, but as I've built more I've realized that a
fully working, ready-to-go starter project would save a ton of time.

## Features

* [Elixir 1.4.4](http://elixir-lang.org) for the backend, with [Phoenix 1.2.1](phoenixframework.org) configured for Postgres
* [Elm 0.18](http://elm-lang.org/) for the frontend
* Auth through Twitter (extendible to other OAuth providers through [Guardian](https://github.com/ueberauth/guardian)]/[Ueberauth](https://github.com/ueberauth/ueberauth))
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic Javascript package management
* Dockerized for easy development and deployment
* [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo) for Elixir linting
* Thorough Elixir tests
* Configured for Circle CI for easy testing and linting

## Starting things up

Once you've customized the code (see the next section), run:

* `mix deps.get` to get the Phoenix dependencies
* `yarn install` to get Javascript dependencies
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose run web mix ecto.create`
* `docker-compose run web mix ecto.migrate`
* `docker-compose up`

Once it's up and running, `docker-compose run web mix ecto.migrate` and `docker-compose up` should
be all you need on an ongoing basis.

When the server is running, check out [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) -- it comes with a
login link that'll auth you with Twitter!

## Customizing this Repo

To set up a new project, you'll want to set up a few things:

### Choose a project name

* Replace `elmelixirstarter` with `yourprojectname` (case sensitive)
* Replace `Elmelixirstarter` with `Yourprojectname` (case sensitive)
* `mv lib/elmelixirstarter lib/${YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}`
* `mv lib/elmelixirstarter.ex lib/${YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}.ex`
* Change the project name in web/templates/layout/app.html.eex
* Change the database name in `docker-compose.yml`

### Set up credentials
* Set Twitter credentials appropriately in config/twitter.exs
* Set a Phoenix secret key in `config/config.exs`
* Set a Guardian secret key (for auth) in `config/config.exs`

## Known issues / to do

There are a few things that would make this more useful:

* There are a bunch of steps to customize the repo; the string replacement and file moving could probably be scripted.
* Elixir compiles each time you execute a `docker-compose run` command,/elm even though the Dockerfile includes `mix compile`.
* Circle CI runs on a different, easier-to-set-up base image than Docker
* It doesn't start up with any cute images or instructions.

Overall, I'm not an expert on Elm, Elixir, or Docker, so there may well be better ways to
accomplish some of what I've done -- if you see some, let me know! Feedback, issues, and pull
requests are very welcome.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Richard Whaling](https://github.com/rwhaling) for his invaluable help setting up Docker
and for his pairing on an earlier Elm+Elixir project, to [Gursimran
Singh](https://github.com/gnarmis) for his work at [eSpark Learning](http://esparklearning.com) on
Elixir and Docker, and, of course, the amazing people who've built all the technologies in this
repo.

### Elm (frontend)

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) has strong community guidelines for formatting code and a utility that can [automatically
format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) for you. Make sure to install appropriate editor
packages/formatters:

* vim: [elm-vim](https://github.com/ElmCast/elm-vim)
* Atom (not personally tested): [language](https://atom.io/packages/language-elm),
